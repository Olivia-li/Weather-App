# Weather-App

This weather app uses the Dark Sky API to grab the current weather and a seven day forecast for your current location. Users can also look at the weather of any location at anytime in the past by toggling the settings. A narrator with a smooth British accent will also give a summary of the weather whenever users click back to the main weather screen.
